    <?php echo genesis_html5() ? '<article>' : '<div>'; ?>

## I saw that you have a search form in the deno of sitemap on your website?

You can add StudioPress Genesis snippet to add search. We actually used Google Custom Search.

## There is a link at bottom towards your website?

It is for a false hope if 1-2 peoples ever keep it to say thanks. 

## Is there any support?

Nope. But you can open issues if you find bugs.
